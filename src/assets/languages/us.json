We started our activities with the name “Saboaria Conquistense”, producing painted soap, which, with its marbled pattern, resembled a tegu, a reptile characteristic of the sertão. It was from this similarity that the TEIÚ brand was born, initially composed of a line of products that were distributed throughout the region, becoming, years later, a reference throughout the country. We have always prioritized the quality of our products, respect for human and environmental values, principles that were decisive for us to achieve a prominent place in the competitive segment of cleaning and personal hygiene products throughout Brazil. Throughout our history, we have always sought technological advances to offer the market products that facilitate the daily lives of our consumers. For this, we permanently carry out research and technical studies for the development of our lines, which guarantees a standard of quality and superior efficiency.",
            "second-paragraph": "In addition, we keep up with changing consumer habits and diversify our product line, always incorporating innovation to ensure that each item reaches Brazilian homes with the highest quality standards. Thus, with each product purchased, our consumers take with them not only a quality product, but also the values of a company that cares about the well-being of society. Our manufacturing unit occupies an area of more than 30 thousand square meters in the Industrial District of Imborés, in Vitória da Conquista, Bahia. Equipped with high technology, ensuring greater performance in industrial processes, it achieves the performance of more than 100 thousand tons of products per year, which reach the points of sale through a fully computerized distribution center, which streamlines our logistics operation.",
            "third-paragraph": "At each production stage, trained employees contribute to ensuring total quality control and compliance with the strictest standards. On completing 60 YEARS, we reaffirm our values and commitments to consumers, customers, employees and strategic partners. We are a 21st century company, with our own logistics and great prominence on the national scene, exporting our products to the most diverse markets in Brazil."
